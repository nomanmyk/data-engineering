## What is Docker Compose?

Docker Compose is a tool used to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. Instead of running containers one by one and manually linking them, you use a docker-compose.yml file to define all the services, networks, and volumes your application needs in a single place.

## Key Concepts:
	1.	Services: These represent the individual containers. For example, a web application might have a web service (like Flask or Django) and a db service (like PostgreSQL or MySQL).
	2.	Networks: Docker Compose automatically creates a network for all the services, allowing them to communicate.
	3.	Volumes: Volumes persist data so that it’s not lost when a container is stopped or recreated.
	4.	One Command Deployment: Using docker-compose up, you can spin up all the services defined in the file.

## Basic Structure of a docker-compose.yml file

A typical docker-compose.yml file looks like this:

```
version: '3.8'  # Specify the version of Docker Compose
services:       # Define services
  app:          # Name of the service
    image: python:3.9-slim  # Base image
    volumes:
      - .:/app  # Map current directory to /app inside the container
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"  # Expose port 5000
    command: python app.py  # Command to run inside the container

  db:           # Another service for database
    image: postgres:14
    environment:  # Environment variables for the database
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: mydatabase
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:  # Define volumes for persistent storage
  postgres_data:
```


Key Commands
	1.	Start the application:

docker-compose up

This builds and runs all the services.

	2.	Stop the application:

docker-compose down

Stops the containers and removes networks, but keeps volumes.

	3.	Rebuild services after changes:

docker-compose up --build

Benefits of Docker Compose
	•	Simplifies multi-container orchestration: No need to run multiple docker run commands.
	•	Environment Configuration: Easily manage development, staging, and production setups.
	•	Scalability: You can scale services (e.g., multiple instances of web) with just one command:

docker-compose up --scale web=3
